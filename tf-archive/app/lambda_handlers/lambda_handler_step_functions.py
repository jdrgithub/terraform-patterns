# Lambda runs as a task in a Step Functions workflow, often expecting structured JSON in and out.
'''
Why it's different:
Step Functions expects clean JSON in/out

Failures donâ€™t throw exceptions unless you want to catch them in a Catch block

Use ResultPath and OutputPath in your state definition to control JSON shape
